content-speak: "Recently, generative retrieval-based recommendation systems (GRs) have emerged as a promising paradigm by directly generating candidate items in an autoregressive manner. However, most modern recommender systems adopt a retrieve-and-rank strategy, where the generative model functions only as a selector during the retrieval stage. In this talk, we will discuss the key limitations of current recommender systems, Onerec's industrial deployment insights, and the future challenges and opportunities in this evolving field."
bio: <b>Dr. Shiyao Wang</b> is a researcher in the field of  multimodal and recommendation systems. She is currently affiliated with Kuaishou Technology, where she leads innovative research projects that bridge the gap between retrieval, ranking, and generative recommendation systems. Her work includes contributions such as OneRec, which unifies retrieval and ranking with generative recommender and iterative preference alignment, and she continues to drive forward the emerging topics in multimodal and recommendation systems.

                        The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era of generative AI, exhibiting broad human-level capabilities and achieving meaningful progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  To realize AGI that truly benefits each individual, one next key direction for generative AI is to develop personal intelligenceâ€”understanding individuals and enhancing personal thinking, planning, and life experiences through personalization. Although evolving generative AI toward personal intelligence is emerging, it has attracted considerable interest from both research institutions and industry, even becoming a strategic direction for many companies. This workshop aims to provide a platform for discussing innovative ideas that facilitate the transition from generative AI to personal intelligence, (i) envisioning the future of personal intelligence powered by generative AI, (ii) establishing benchmarks for personal intelligence tasks, (iii) advancing user modeling/personalization techniques for generative models/agents, (iv) enhancing real-world applications, and (v) ensuring privacy and trustworthiness. This workshop aims to deepen understanding, accelerate progress, and support the transformative development of the next generation of generative AI: personal intelligence.

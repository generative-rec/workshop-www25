          Generative AI, propelled by advancements in large language models, has achieved remarkable milestones. As we look ahead, equipping generative AI with personalization capabilities and progressing toward personal intelligence are essential steps in its evolution toward deeply and meaningfully serving each individualâ€”and ultimately toward AGI. The Generative AI Towards Personal Intelligence workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to explore cutting-edge developments in personal intelligence within generative AI. This workshop will focus on inspiring future perspectives, advancing technological innovations, establishing standards, and enhancing practical applications for generative AI-driven personal intelligence.

            Submitted papers must be a single PDF file in the template of ACM WWW 2025. Submissions can be of varying length from 4 to 8 pages, plus unlimited pages for references. The authors may decide on the appropriate length of the paper as no distinction is made between long and short papers. All submitted papers will follow the "double-blind" review policy and undergo the same review process and duration. Expert peer reviewers in the field will assess all papers based on their relevance to the workshop, scientific novelty, and technical quality.        </p>
